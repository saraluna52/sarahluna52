### 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah

I’m a data analyst interested in making sense of systems to drive real-world impact. I’m especially drawn to work that touches waste reduction and safe waste management, regenerative food systems, and energy optimization. I use data to explore what’s possible and to recommend what’s practical. 

I'm currently an MS student in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University MET College. I love learning languages (human and programming!)

I have 10+ yrs of professional experience in grants and project management. I have also worked on farms and in public outreach and communications for the solid waste industry.   

Currently building my portfolio and open to roles in:
- Data analysis & forecasting
- Business intelligence
- Energy & sustainability strategies
- Waste management optimization
- Food systems
